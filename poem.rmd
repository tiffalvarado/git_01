In the hush before the light,  
Shadows linger, dreams take flight.  
The world wrapped in a silken veil,  
As night begins to softly pale.  
Morning dew on blades of grass,  
A fleeting moment, soon to pass.  
Birds awaken, songs arise,  
Painting colors in the skies.  
Clouds like whispers drift and sway,  
Chasing remnants of the day.  
Each sunbeam casts a gentle glow,  
Unfolding stories, yet untold.  
Fields of gold and skies of blue,  
Nature's canvas, ever new.  
Time meanders, slow and free,  
In the dance of eternity.  
As the world begins to stir,  
Life awakens, hearts confer.  
With every breath, a chance to start,  
A new beginning, a hopeful heart.  
So linger here, in morningâ€™s grace,  
Embrace the beauty, find your place.  
For every dawn, a promise made,  
In whispered light, our fears allayed.
