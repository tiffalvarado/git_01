## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
And the mome raths outgrabe.  

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
The frumious Bandersnatch!"  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the hush before the light,  
Shadows linger, dreams take flight.  
The world wrapped in a silken veil,  
As night begins to softly pale.  
Morning dew on blades of grass,  
A fleeting moment, soon to pass.  
Birds awaken, songs arise,  
Painting colors in the skies.  
Clouds like whispers drift and sway,  
Chasing remnants of the day.  
Each sunbeam casts a gentle glow,  
Unfolding stories, yet untold.  
Fields of gold and skies of blue,  
Nature's canvas, ever new.  
Time meanders, slow and free,  
In the dance of eternity.  
As the world begins to stir,  
Life awakens, hearts confer.  
With every breath, a chance to start,  
A new beginning, a hopeful heart.  
So linger here, in morning’s grace,  
Embrace the beauty, find your place.  
For every dawn, a promise made,  
In whispered light, our fears allayed.
